        <h3>Poem</h3>
        <p>
            A nation of trees, drab green and desolate grey<sup>1</sup><br>
            In the field uniform of modern wars<sup>2</sup><br>
            Darkens her hills, those endless, outstretched paws<sub>3</sub><br>
            Of Sphinx demolished or stone lion worn away.<sub>4</sub><br>
            <br>
            They call her a young country, but they lie:<br>
            She is the last of lands, the emptiest,<br>
            A woman beyond her change of life, a breast<br>
            Still tender but within the womb is dry.<br>
            <br>
            Without songs, architecture, history:<br>
            The emotions and superstitions of younger lands,<br>
            Her rivers of water drown among inland sands,<br>
            The river of her immense stupidity<br>
            <br>
            Floods her monotonous tribes from Cairns to Perth.<br>
            In them at last the ultimate men arrive<br>
            Whose boast is not: 'we live' but 'we survive',<br>
            A type who will inhabit the dying earth.<br>
            <br>
            And her five cities, like five teeming sores,<br>
            Each drains her: a vast parasite robber-state<br>
            Where second-hand Europeans pullulate<br>
            Timidly on the edge of alien shores.<br>
            <br>
            Yet there are some like me turn gladly home<br>
            From the lush jungle of modern thought, to find<br>
            The Arabian desert of the human mind,<br>
            Hoping, if still from the deserts the prophets come,<br>
            <br>
            Such savage and scarlet as no green hills dare<br>
            Springs in that waste, some spirit which escapes<br>
            The learned doubt, the chatter of cultured apes<br>
            Which is called civilization over there.<br>
